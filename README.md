.std-formation
==============

StandardTextData formation.

STD text data formation has been projected
to bypass **CSV** primitiveness and **JSON** crowded standardization due to achive better defined tree formed data constructions
and eliminate cross reference errors.
it maybe identified as treefied csv data for javascipt.

heading key nodes are determined at [0],
child branch counts might not be named but interpreted from arising element which should have been private for each member naturally.
