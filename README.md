### StandardTextData formation.

STD text data formation has been projected
to bypass **CSV** primitiveness and **JSON** crowded standardization due to achive better defined tree formed data constructions
and eliminate cross reference errors.
it maybe identified as treefied csv data for javascipt.

heading key nodes are determined at **[0]**,
child branch counts might not be named but interpreted from arising element which should have been private for each member naturally.
```html

VAR MYARRAYDATA.STD = [
  {ID  ,NAME ,LASTNAME ,HOBBIES                                      ,REVENUES                           ,CHILDS     ,PARENTS}, 
  {001 ,A    ,A        ,{SURF, ATHLETISM{MARATHON,DECATHLON}, MUSIC} ,{2014{MARCH{$2000},APRIL{$1750}}}  ,{012,003}  ,dead},
  {002 ,B    ,B        ,{BOXING, SEX}                                ,{2014{APRIL{$150}}}                ,003        ,dead},
  {003 ,C    ,A        ,                                             ,{2014{MARCH{$6000},APRIL{$8750}}}  ,           ,{FATHER{002,001},MOTHER{/*other kind parenthoods "reverse.Tree" */}}},
  {004 ,C    ,A        ,{ARCADE}                                     ,                                   ,           ,001},
 ^ not the same person with '003'.
  ...
  ..
  .
];
```
as it seen data formation itself tells much the way it is constructed. ex. Member 003 which works hard gets his desperade father labored at his fatherinlaw's company. 

{,{},,} outcome sampling surpresses needing **relational table data** with distinct tree branches.

with recent data formations you have to replicate record of a member more in **tree** as a "legal-child" and "orginal-child".
that presentation unify each member that might be related different tree branches.

Pros:
* Natural,easy and clean presentation.
* Local availability.
* Object & nodes usage.
* Reverse Tree.
* Relational Infinite Tree Branches.
* Size reduction.
* easy faster filtering.
